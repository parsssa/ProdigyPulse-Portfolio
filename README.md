# ProdigyPulse React Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using React. It provides information about me, showcases my skills and presents my projects. 
It was the first software project that I carried out completely on my own, so it definitely has a special special place in my heart. Realistically a simple website like this could have been made with Wordpress, but at the time I decided to dive into front-end and feel like a coder, so I did a little bit of research and ultimately picked the React JS framework. 
After a lot of tutorials and late-nights spent coding at a coffee shop, I finally deployed the site to Github Pages, and now I own a small corner of the internet. Amazing, right?
